### File Setup
###### gif_layers
-All trait types should have their GIFs in a respective folder within gif_layers
-Nested folder structure is not supported



### How To Run
1. From the nft_gif_generatooor directory run the below command for a 1 time conversion of all GIF files into their separate PNG files required to produce final GIF. These files will be stored in the GIF_DECONSTRUCTED_LAYERS_PATH defined in config.py. If left unchanged, this should create a '/gif_deconstructed_layers' subdirectory within your local copy of the repo.
```
python3 src/convert_gif_to_png.py
